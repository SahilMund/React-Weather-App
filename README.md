# React Weather App

## Description :-
```
This project involves creating a weather app using React that allows users to search for a city and view current weather conditions and a five-day forecast. The app will integrate with one or more open weather APIs to retrieve weather data. Users will be able to enter a city name in the search bar to retrieve the current temperature, weather icon, and description for that city. The app will also display a five-day forecast that includes temperature and weather icons. The goal is to create a visually appealing and functional weather app that provides users with quick access to weather information for any city they choose.
